# Diffrn

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ambient_pressure** | **float** | The mean hydrostatic pressure in kilopascals at which the  intensities were measured. | [optional] 
**ambient_temp** | **float** | The mean temperature in kelvins at which the intensities were  measured. | [optional] 
**ambient_temp_details** | **str** | A description of special aspects of temperature control during  data collection. | [optional] 
**crystal_id** | **str** | This data item is a pointer to _exptl_crystal.id in the  EXPTL_CRYSTAL category. | [optional] 
**crystal_support** | **str** | The physical device used to support the crystal during data  collection. | [optional] 
**details** | **str** | Special details of the diffraction measurement process. Should  include information about source instability, crystal motion,  degradation and so on. | [optional] 
**id** | **str** | This data item uniquely identifies a set of diffraction  data. | 
**pdbx_serial_crystal_experiment** | **str** | Y/N if using serial crystallography experiment in which multiple crystals contribute to each diffraction frame in the experiment. | [optional]
