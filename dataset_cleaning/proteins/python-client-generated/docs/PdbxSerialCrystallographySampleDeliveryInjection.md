# PdbxSerialCrystallographySampleDeliveryInjection

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**carrier_solvent** | **str** | For continuous sample flow experiments, the carrier buffer used  to move the sample into the beam. Should include protein  concentration. | [optional] 
**crystal_concentration** | **float** | For continuous sample flow experiments, the concentration of  crystals in the solution being injected.   The concentration is measured in million crystals/ml. | [optional] 
**description** | **str** | For continuous sample flow experiments, a description of the injector used  to move the sample into the beam. | [optional] 
**diffrn_id** | **str** | The data item is a pointer to _diffrn.id in the DIFFRN  category. | 
**filter_size** | **float** | The size of filter in micrometres in filtering crystals | [optional] 
**flow_rate** | **float** | For continuous sample flow experiments, the flow rate of  solution being injected  measured in ul/min. | [optional] 
**injector_diameter** | **float** | For continuous sample flow experiments, the diameter of the  injector in micrometres. | [optional] 
**injector_nozzle** | **str** | The type of nozzle to deliver and focus sample jet | [optional] 
**injector_pressure** | **float** | For continuous sample flow experiments, the mean pressure  in kilopascals at which the sample is injected into the beam. | [optional] 
**injector_temperature** | **float** | For continuous sample flow experiments, the temperature in  Kelvins of the speciman injected. This may be different from  the temperature of the sample. | [optional] 
**jet_diameter** | **float** | Diameter in micrometres of jet stream of sample delivery | [optional] 
**power_by** | **str** | Sample deliver driving force, e.g. Gas, Electronic Potential | [optional] 
**preparation** | **str** | Details of crystal growth and preparation of the crystals | [optional]
