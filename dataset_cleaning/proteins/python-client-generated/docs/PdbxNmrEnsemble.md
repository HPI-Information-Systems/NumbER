## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**average_constraint_violations_per_residue** | **int** | The average number of constraint violations on a per residue basis for  the ensemble. | [optional] 
**average_constraints_per_residue** | **int** | The average number of constraints per residue for the ensemble | [optional] 
**average_distance_constraint_violation** | **float** | The average distance restraint violation for the ensemble. | [optional] 
**average_torsion_angle_constraint_violation** | **float** | The average torsion angle constraint violation for the ensemble. | [optional] 
**conformer_selection_criteria** | **str** | By highlighting the appropriate choice(s), describe how the submitted conformer (models) were selected. | [optional] 
**conformers_calculated_total_number** | **int** | The total number of conformer (models) that were calculated in the final round. | [optional] 
**conformers_submitted_total_number** | **int** | The number of conformer (models) that are submitted for the ensemble. | [optional] 
**distance_constraint_violation_method** | **str** | Describe the method used to calculate the distance constraint violation statistics,  i.e. are they calculated over all the distance constraints or calculated for  violations only? | [optional] 
**maximum_distance_constraint_violation** | **float** | The maximum distance constraint violation for the ensemble. | [optional] 
**maximum_lower_distance_constraint_violation** | **float** | The maximum lower distance constraint violation for the ensemble. | [optional] 
**maximum_torsion_angle_constraint_violation** | **float** | The maximum torsion angle constraint violation for the ensemble. | [optional] 
**maximum_upper_distance_constraint_violation** | **float** | The maximum upper distance constraint violation for the ensemble. | [optional] 
**representative_conformer** | **int** | The number of the conformer identified as most representative. | [optional] 
**torsion_angle_constraint_violation_method** | **str** | This item describes the method used to calculate the torsion angle constraint violation statistics. i.e. are the entered values based on all torsion angle or calculated for violations only? | [optional]
