Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**collection_time_total** | **float** | The total number of hours required to measure this data set. | [optional] 
**collimation** | **str** | The collimation or type of focusing optics applied to the radiation. | [optional] 
**diffrn_id** | **str** | The data item is a pointer to _diffrn.id in the DIFFRN  category. | 
**focal_spot_size** | **float** | The focal spot size of the beam  impinging on the sample (micrometres squared). | [optional] 
**photons_per_pulse** | **float** | The photons per pulse measured in  (tera photons (10^(12)^)/pulse units). | [optional] 
**pulse_duration** | **float** | The average duration (femtoseconds)         of the pulse energy measured at the sample. | [optional] 
**pulse_energy** | **float** | The energy/pulse of the X-ray pulse impacting the sample measured in microjoules. | [optional] 
**pulse_photon_energy** | **float** | The photon energy of the X-ray pulse measured in KeV. | [optional] 
**source_distance** | **float** | The distance from source to the sample along the optical axis (metres). | [optional] 
**source_size** | **float** | The dimension of the source beam measured at the source (micrometres squared). | [optional] 
**xfel_pulse_repetition_rate** | **float** | For FEL experiments, the pulse repetition rate measured in cycles per seconds. | [optional]
