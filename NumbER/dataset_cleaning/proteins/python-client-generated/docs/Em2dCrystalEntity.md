# Em2dCrystalEntity

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**angle_gamma** | **float** | Unit-cell angle gamma in degrees. | [optional] 
**c_sampling_length** | **float** | Length used to sample the reciprocal lattice lines in the c-direction. | [optional] 
**id** | **str** | PRIMARY KEY | 
**image_processing_id** | **str** | pointer to _em_image_processing.id in the EM_IMAGE_PROCESSING category. | 
**length_a** | **float** | Unit-cell length a in angstroms. | [optional] 
**length_b** | **float** | Unit-cell length b in angstroms. | [optional] 
**length_c** | **float** | Thickness of 2D crystal | [optional] 
**space_group_name_h_m** | **str** | There are 17 plane groups classified as oblique, rectangular, square, and hexagonal.  To describe the symmetry of 2D crystals of biological molecules,  plane groups are expanded to equivalent noncentrosymmetric space groups.  The 2D crystal plane corresponds to the &#x27;ab&#x27; plane of the space group.   Enumerated space group descriptions include the plane group number in parentheses,  the H-M plane group symbol, and the plane group class. | [optional]
